Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on.

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on.


Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you opened the door
And you're here in my heart,
And my heart will go on and on.
